</b>CRCWeb is an evidence-based app/web program that offers information and support to people with colorectal cancer and their family members. The program is designed to help you cope with the cancer and mental health.

<b>Why is CRCWeb developed?</b>
When someone has colorectal cancer, it affects the whole family. For this reason, we have built a program to support both the person with colorectal cancer. The program is designed to help you build on the things you do well and work on things you may like to improve.

<b>What device should I use CRCWeb?</b>
You can use CRCWeb app or website on your personal device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop, PC). CRCWeb is supported by most browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge).

<b>Do we have to do the program in a particular order?</b>
The program consists of 3 modules. You will be able to do a new module every month. We'll send you a reminder email weekly to review the modules.

<b>What will happen to my information?</b>
During the surveys, you may share some personal information with us. Your information will be kept private aligned with the HIPAA rules set by the Emory Institutional Review Boards.

<b>Can I go back to the modules?</b>
You can return to a module anytime and review the information on a module anytime. You can review a module alone or together.

<b>How long do I have access to the CRCWeb platform?</b>
You will be able to access the three different modules over a period of 3 month. After your participation, you will still be able to access the CRCWeb program for three months to review the modules, information and resources.

<b>How does this program fit in with my treatment?</b>
The CRCWeb program is designed to work alongside the standard care you receive from your health care providers. It is in no way a replacement for your usual healthcare.
