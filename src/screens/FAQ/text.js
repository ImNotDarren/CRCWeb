export const text = '<b>What is CRCweb?</b>\nCRCweb is an evidence-based app/web program that offers information and support to people with colorectal cancer and their family members. The program is designed to help you cope with the cancer and work together as a team.\n\n<b>Why is CRCweb developed?</b>\nWhen someone has colorectal cancer, it affects the whole family. For this reason, we have built a program to support both the person with colorectal cancer and their family. The program is designed to help you build on the things you do well and work on things you may like to improve.\n\n<b>What device should I use CRCweb?</b>\nYou can use CRCweb app or website on your personal device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop, PC). CRCweb is supported by most browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge).\n\n<b>Do we have to do the program in a particular order?</b>\nThe program consists of 3 modules. You will be able to do a new module every two weeks. We’ll send you a reminder email weekly to review the modules.\n\n<b>What will happen to my information?</b>\nDuring the surveys, you may share some personal information with us. Your information will be kept private aligned with the HIPAA rules set by the Emory Institutional Review Boards.\n\n<b>Can I go back to the modules?</b>\nYou can return to a module anytime and review the information on a module anytime. You can review a module alone or together.\n\n<b>Can I do the modules by myself?</b>\nWe encourage you to work in a team. The modules contain information that help and support both of you. Please wait until you are together with your loved one to complete the program.\n\n<b>How long do I have access to the CRCweb platform?</b>\nYou will be able to access the three different modules over a period of 8 weeks. After your participation, you will still be able to access the CRCweb program for three months to review the modules, information and resources.\n\n<b>How does this program fit in with my treatment?</b>\nThe CRCweb program is designed to work alongside the standard care you receive from your health care providers. It is in no way a replacement for your usual healthcare.\n\n<b>Who can I reach out to if I have a question that hasn’t been answered here?</b>\nIf you still have a question about the CRCweb program that have not been listed here, please contact Dr. Yufen Lin at yufen.lin.470@gmail.com or (404)251-4072.';
